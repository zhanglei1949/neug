# Transaction Management

This document describes NeuG's transaction management system, which operates differently depending on the deployment mode. NeuG supports two primary modes: **Embedded mode** suitable for analytical processing (AP) and **Service mode** suitable for transactional processing (TP).

## Design Philosophy

NeuG's transaction model reflects trade-offs based on deep understanding of graph workload characteristics:

- **Graph-native workloads** are predominantly read-heavy with insert operations, while updates and schema changes are relatively infrequent
- **Analytical workloads** prioritize single-query throughput over complex consistency guarantees
- **Transactional workloads** require concurrent read/insert performance with strong isolation

Rather than implementing a one-size-fits-all transaction system with high complexity, NeuG provides workload-appropriate guarantees that balance simplicity, performance, and correctness.

## Transaction Model

NeuG keeps auto-commit semantics as the default in every currently supported
interface: each `execute()` or `Query()` call is one statement-level
transaction.

```python
# Each execute() is an independent, auto-committed transaction.
conn.execute("CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Alice'})")  # Transaction 1
conn.execute("CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Bob'})")    # Transaction 2
```

### Explicit Transactions in Embedded C++ AP Mode

The embedded C++ `Connection` API additionally supports programmatic explicit
transactions for AP mode. A transaction is owned by its `Connection` and spans
multiple `Query()` calls:

```cpp
auto status = conn->BeginTransaction(neug::TransactionMode::kReadWrite);
if (!status.ok()) {
  // Handle the begin error.
}

auto created = conn->Query("CREATE (:Person {name: 'Alice'})", "insert");
auto visible = conn->Query("MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name", "read");

status = conn->Commit();  // Publishes all successful writes as one commit.
```

`TransactionMode::kReadOnly` pins one read view for the entire transaction and
rejects writes. `TransactionMode::kReadWrite` holds one private COW write view:
its successful statements can read their own writes, while other connections do
not observe them until `Commit()` succeeds. AP read-write transactions hold the
existing exclusive AP admission for their full lifetime, so a long-running
transaction blocks new AP reads and writes.

An ordinary statement failure, a read-only write, or a rejected bulk or
maintenance operation aborts the owner and leaves the connection
rollback-only. In that state, call `Rollback()` (or `Close()`) before issuing
another query or beginning another transaction. `HasActiveTransaction()` stays
true while the connection is rollback-only. Nested begin and invalid control
calls report a transaction-state error without changing an otherwise active
transaction.

This first API does **not** accept Cypher `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, or `ROLLBACK`;
use the C++ methods above. It also does not yet include TP service sessions,
remote clients, Python or Java bindings, savepoints, transaction timeouts, or
explicit-transaction `COPY`, batch, index, checkpoint, mutating procedure, or temporary
schema operations.

## Deployment Modes Overview

| Aspect | Embedded Mode | Service Mode |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Use Case** | Analytics, ETL, batch processing | Interactive applications, web services |
| **Concurrency** | Single-user, sequential writes | Multi-user, concurrent access |
| **Persistence** | Explicit checkpoint-based | Automatic WAL-based |
| **Optimization Goal** | Maximum single-query performance | Concurrent read/insert throughput |

## ACID Properties

### Embedded Mode (AP-oriented)

Embedded mode is designed for analytical workloads where simplicity and single-query performance take precedence over complex transaction guarantees.

#### Atomicity

Ordinary AP writes use a private COW graph and publish it only after their WAL
commit succeeds. Persistent direct bulk operations use the same private graph
and publish a checkpoint on success; temporary bulk objects are in-memory only.
An explicit read-write transaction accumulates its supported ordinary writes in
one private graph and publishes them only at `Commit()`.

The current WAL format is sufficient for normal replay, but its final framing,
corruption handling, and commit-unknown recovery rules are still being
hardened. Applications requiring a durable materialized checkpoint after bulk
loading should use the checkpoint lifecycle described in
[Checkpoints](checkpoint.md).

#### Consistency

Schema constraints and referential integrity are enforced at the statement level. Invalid operations (such as creating duplicate primary keys or violating edge constraints) are rejected.

#### Isolation

**Pessimistic exclusive locking** is used for all write operations. Any write statement (insert, update, delete, or schema modification) acquires an exclusive lock, blocking all other operations until completion.

| Operation Type | Concurrency Behavior |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Read + Read | Concurrent execution allowed |
| Write + READ/Write | Mutually exclusive |

This simple locking model is sufficient for single-user analytical workloads and avoids the complexity of fine-grained concurrency control.

#### Durability

Ordinary AP writes, including one successful explicit read-write commit, append
logical redo to the WAL and are replayed on a normal restart. Persistent direct
bulk operations become durable by publishing their checkpoint. An explicit
`CHECKPOINT` statement or database closure with `checkpoint_on_close=True`
creates a materialized checkpoint and manages WAL rotation.

For in-memory databases, durability is not applicable as data exists only in volatile memory.
For usage and failure behavior, see [Checkpoints](checkpoint.md).

### Service Mode

Service mode is designed for high-throughput transactional workloads with concurrent client access. The concurrency model is optimized for graph-native access patterns where reads and inserts dominate.

#### Atomicity

Each statement executes as an all-or-nothing operation. Failed statements are automatically rolled back with no partial state changes visible to other transactions.

#### Consistency

Schema constraints and referential integrity are enforced. All concurrent operations observe a consistent view of the database.

#### Isolation

NeuG uses **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** to provide serializable isolation, with operation-specific concurrency rules:

| Operation Type | Concurrency Behavior |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Read | Reads a consistent snapshot and continues during active inserts/updates. |
| Insert | Concurrent with reads and other inserts. Waits if an update is in progress. |
| Update | One at a time. Reads continue on a consistent snapshot. Inserts and other updates wait until the update finishes. |
| Schema (DDL) | Same concurrency behavior as update. |
| Checkpoint | Exclusive maintenance. See [Checkpoints](checkpoint.md). |

> Note: A read that arrives while an update is finishing may wait briefly,
> typically at millisecond scale.

**Design Rationale:** This hybrid approach reflects the reality of graph workloads:

- **Reads and inserts** are the dominant operations in most graph applications (social networks, knowledge graphs, recommendation systems)
- **Updates and schema changes** are relatively rare and are serialized, while reads continue on a consistent snapshot with only brief waits when they arrive as a write is finishing
- **Checkpoints** are database-level maintenance operations; their concurrency behavior is described in [Checkpoints](checkpoint.md)
- Full MVCC for all write types would add significant complexity with minimal benefit for typical graph workloads

```python
from neug import Session

# Concurrent sessions
session1 = Session("http://localhost:10000/")
session2 = Session("http://localhost:10000/")

# These can execute concurrently (read + insert)
session1.execute("MATCH (p:Person) RETURN count(p)", access_mode="read")
session2.execute("CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Bob'})", access_mode="insert")

# This is serialized with inserts and other updates. Reads continue on a
# consistent snapshot while the update runs.
session1.execute("MATCH (p:Person) SET p.updated = true", access_mode="update")
```

#### Durability

All modifications are immediately persisted through **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**:

- Changes are logged to WAL before execution completes
- Crash recovery automatically replays WAL to restore consistent state
- No explicit checkpoint is required for durability; checkpoints are available for WAL consolidation. See [Checkpoints](checkpoint.md)

## Access Mode

When executing queries, you can specify an `access_mode` to control transaction behavior and optimize performance:

| Mode | Aliases | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `read` | `r` | Read-only operations (MATCH without mutations) |
| `insert` | `i` | Insert-only operations (CREATE new vertices/edges) |
| `update` | `u` | Update/delete operations (SET, DELETE, MERGE) |
| `schema` | `s` | Schema modifications (CREATE/DROP node/edge tables) |

**Default Behavior:** If not specified, NeuG infers the appropriate mode. Explicitly specifying the correct mode enables better concurrency optimization in Service mode.

**Access Mode Capabilities:** Access modes are operation-specific rather than a strict hierarchy. In Service mode, `read` and `insert` are narrow modes, while `update` and `schema` use the general serialized update path. Using a mode that does not support the planned operation returns an error.

The following table applies to **Service mode** only:

| Specified Mode | Actual Operation | Result |
|----------------|------------------|--------|
| `read` | read | ✅ OK |
| `read` | insert/update/schema/checkpoint | ❌ Error |
| `insert` | insert | ✅ OK |
| `insert` | read/update/schema/checkpoint | ❌ Error |
| `update` | read/insert/update/schema/checkpoint | ✅ OK (serialized update path) |
| `schema` | read/insert/update/schema | ✅ OK (serialized update path) |

In Embedded mode, modes other than `read` primarily select shared versus exclusive query locking rather than distinct transaction implementations. Explicit `read` still rejects write operations, and the special `CHECKPOINT` restriction below applies in both deployment modes.

`CHECKPOINT` is a special administrative statement. See
[Checkpoints](checkpoint.md) for its accepted access modes and
`EXPLAIN`/`PROFILE` behavior.

```python
# Optimal: match access mode to operation for best concurrency
conn.execute("MATCH (n) RETURN n", access_mode="read")        # read lock only
conn.execute("CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Alice'})", access_mode="insert")  # insert lock

# Works but suboptimal: update mode for read query enters the update path
conn.execute("MATCH (n) RETURN n", access_mode="update")      # works, but reduces write concurrency
```

## Data Persistence

### Embedded Mode: Checkpoint-Based

All changes are held in memory until a checkpoint persists them. See
[Checkpoints](checkpoint.md) for usage, examples, and recovery behavior.

### Service Mode: WAL-Based

Changes are automatically persisted through Write-Ahead Logging:

```python
from neug import Session

session = Session("http://localhost:10000/")

# Each statement is immediately durable
session.execute("CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Alice'})")  # Persisted via WAL
session.execute("CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Bob'})")    # Persisted via WAL

session.close()
```

An optional checkpoint consolidates the WAL but is not required for statement
durability. See [Checkpoints](checkpoint.md).

## Error Recovery

### Embedded Mode

Recovery relies on the last successful checkpoint. See
[Recovering from a failed Embedded write](checkpoint.md) for an example.

### Service Mode

Automatic crash recovery using WAL:

- Uncommitted operations are automatically rolled back
- Database restores to last consistent state on startup
- No manual intervention required

## Best Practices

### Embedded Mode

```python
import neug

db = neug.Database("/path/to/database")
conn = db.connect()

# 1. Create schema and checkpoint
conn.execute("CREATE NODE TABLE Person(id INT64, name STRING, PRIMARY KEY(id))")
conn.execute("CREATE NODE TABLE Company(id INT64, name STRING, PRIMARY KEY(id))")
conn.execute("CREATE REL TABLE WORKS_AT(FROM Person TO Company)")
conn.execute("CHECKPOINT")

# 2. Load data in batches with periodic checkpoints
conn.execute("COPY Person FROM 'employees_batch1.csv'")
conn.execute("COPY Person FROM 'employees_batch2.csv'")
conn.execute("CHECKPOINT")

conn.execute("COPY Company FROM 'companies.csv'")
conn.execute("COPY WORKS_AT FROM 'employment.csv'")
conn.execute("CHECKPOINT")

# 3. Run analytical queries (read-only, high performance)
result = conn.execute("MATCH (p:Person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(c:Company) RETURN c.name, count(p)")

conn.close()
db.close()
```

### Service Mode (TP-oriented)

```python
from neug import Session

session = Session("http://localhost:10000/")

try:
    # Reads and inserts can be concurrent across sessions
    session.execute("CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Alice'})", access_mode="insert")
    
    # Reads don't block inserts
    result = session.execute("MATCH (p:Person) RETURN count(p)", access_mode="read")
    
    # Updates are serialized with inserts and other updates. Reads continue on
    # consistent snapshots, but keep updates short in high-concurrency scenarios.
    session.execute("MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.name = 'Alice' SET p.verified = true", 
                   access_mode="update")
    
    # Periodic checkpoint to consolidate WAL (optional)
    session.execute("CHECKPOINT")
    
finally:
    session.close()
```
