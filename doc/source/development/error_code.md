# NeuG Error Codes

NeuG defines all runtime/service error codes in the protobuf file [`error.proto`](https://github.com/alibaba/neug/blob/main/proto/error.proto). The enums in that file are compiled into every component, so developers should treat the definitions there as the single source of truth. The table below summarizes each code and its meaning for quick reference while debugging or surfacing errors.

| Category | Code | Numeric Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| General | `OK` | 0 | Successful operation; no error. |
| General | `ERR_PERMISSION` | 1001 | Operation blocked due to missing permissions. |

| General | `ERR_UNKNOWN` | 9999 | Unclassified error; inspect logs for context. |

**Tip:** When adding new error codes, update `proto/error.proto` first, regenerate the protobuf outputs if necessary, and extend this document so other developers can discover the new code quickly.
