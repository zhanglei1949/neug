# Export Data

The `COPY TO` command enables direct export of query results to various file formats. Currently, CSV export is fully supported, with additional formats available through the [Extension](../extensions/index) framework as they are developed.

## Copy to CSV

The COPY TO clause can export query results to a CSV file and is used as follows:
```cypher
COPY (MATCH (p:person) RETURN p.*) TO 'person.csv' (header=true);
```

The CSV file consists of the following fields:
```csv
p.id|p.name|p.age
1|marko|29
2|vadas|27
4|josh|32
6|peter|35
```
Complex types, such as vertices and edges, will be output in their JSON-formatted strings.

Available parameters are:
|Parameter|Description|Default|
|---|---|---|
|`HEADER`|Whether to output a header row.|`true`|
|`DELIM` or `DELIMITER`|Character that separates fields in the CSV.|`\|`|
|`BATCH_SIZE`|Maximum number of rows to write in a single batch.|`1024`|

Another example is shown below.
```cypher
COPY (MATCH (:person)-[e:knows]->(:person) RETURN e) TO 'person_knows_person.csv' (header=true);
```
This outputs the following results to `person_knows_person.csv`:
```csv
e
{"_SRC":"0:0","_DST":"0:1","_SRC_LABEL":"person","_DST_LABEL":"person","_LABEL":"knows","weight":0.5}
{"_SRC":"0:0","_DST":"0:2","_SRC_LABEL":"person","_DST_LABEL":"person","_LABEL":"knows","weight":1.0}
```

## Copy to JSON

Since NeuG v0.1.2, JSON export is a built-in feature. You can export query results to JSON or JSONL format:

```cypher
COPY (MATCH (p:person) RETURN p.*) TO 'person.json';
COPY (MATCH (p:person) RETURN p.*) TO 'person.jsonl';
```

The output format is determined by the file extension:
- `.json` — JSON array format (all rows in a single array)
- `.jsonl` — JSON Lines format (one JSON object per line)

> **Version Note:** Since version v0.1.2, we made JSON support a built-in functionality, so you do not need to install the JSON extension before using it. For NeuG version < 0.1.2, JSON export was provided via the JSON Extension and required `INSTALL json; LOAD json;` before use.

## Additional Export Formats

NeuG is expanding export capabilities through the [Extension](../extensions/index) framework. Planned export formats include:

- **Parquet Export**: High-performance columnar format for analytics and data science workflows
- **DataFrame Integration**: Direct export to pandas DataFrames and other data science tools

See the [Extensions](../extensions/index) page for the latest supported formats.

## Export Best Practices

- **Large Result Sets**: Use LIMIT clauses to avoid memory issues when exporting large datasets
- **Data Types**: Complex graph objects (nodes/edges) are exported as JSON strings for maximum compatibility
- **File Paths**: Ensure the target directory exists and is writable before running export commands
