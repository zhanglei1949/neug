    This class is used to open a database connection and manage the database. User should use this class to
    open a database connection, and then use the `connect` method to get a `Connection` object to interact with the database.

    By passing an empty string as the database path, the database will be opened in memory mode.

    The database could be opened with different modes(read-only or read-write) and different planners.

    When the database is opened in read-only mode, other databases could also open the same database directory in
    read-only mode, inside the same process or in different processes.
    When the database is opened in read-write mode, no other databases could open the same database directory in
    either read-only or read-write mode, inside the same process or in different processes.

    When the database is closed, all the connections to the database will be closed automatically.

        Parameters
        ----------
        db_path : str
            Path to the database file. required. If it is set to empty string, the database will be opened in memory mode.
            Note that in memory mode, the database will not be persisted to disk, and all data will be
            lost when the program exits. In this case, the db_path should not contain any illegal characters.
        mode : str
            Mode to open the database, could be 'r', 'read', 'readwrite', 'w', 'rw', 'write'. Default is 'r' for read-only.
        max_thread_num : int
            Maximum number of threads to use. Default is 0, which means no limit.
        checkpoint_on_close : bool
            Whether to automatically create a checkpoint when the database is closed. Default is True.
            If False, no checkpoint is created automatically when close the database.
        memory_level : str
            Memory level to use for the database, could be 'InMemory', 'SyncToFile' or 'HugePagePreferred'.
            Default is 'InMemory'.
            - 'InMemory': The database will be opened fully in memory, and the changes will not be persisted to disk
              until checkpoint is created.
            - 'SyncToFile': The database will be opened in memory on demand, suitable for large databases that cannot
              fit into memory. Also changes will not be persisted to disk until checkpoint is created.
            - 'HugePagePreferred': Similar to 'InMemory', but it will try to use huge pages for memory allocation,
              which may improve performance for large databases.
