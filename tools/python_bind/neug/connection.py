        Execute a cypher query on the database. User could specify multiple queries in a single string,
        separated by semicolons. The query will be executed in the order they are specified.
        If any query fails, the whole execution will be rolled back.
        If the query is a DDL query, such as `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, etc., the database will be
        modified accordingly.

        For the details of the query syntax, please refer to the documentation of cypher manual.
        The result of the query will be returned as a `QueryResult` object, which contains the result of
        the query and the metadata of the query.
        The QueryResult object is like an iterator, providing methods to iterate over the results,
        such as `__iter__` and `__next__`.

        If the query is a DDL or DML query, the result will be an empty `QueryResult` object.

        Inside an explicit transaction, a failed query leaves the transaction
        rollback-only. Call :meth:`rollback` before executing another query.

        Some of the cypher queries could change the state of the database, such as `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`,
        `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc. Other queries, such as `MATCH(n) RETURN n.id`, will not change the state of
        the database, but will return the results of the query.

        If the database is opened in read-only mode, any DDL or DML query will raise an exception.
        If the database is opened in read-write mode, all queries could be executed, and the state of the
        database will be changed accordingly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        query : str
            The query to execute.
        access_mode : str
            The access mode of the query. It could be `read(r)`, `insert(i)`, `update(u)` (include deletion),
            or `schema(s)` for schema modifications. User should specify the correct access mode for the query
            to ensure the correctness of the database. If the access mode is not specified, it is inferred from
            the query text. Supported access modes are:
            - `read`,`r`,`READ`,`R`: for read-only queries
            - `insert`,`i`,`INSERT`,`I`: for insert-only queries
            - `update`,`u`,`UPDATE`,`U`: for update queries (include deletion)
            - `schema`,`s`,`SCHEMA`,`S`: for schema modification operations
        parameters : dict[str, Any] | None
            The parameters to be used in the query. The parameters should be a dictionary, where the keys are the
            parameter names, and the values are the parameter values. If no parameters are needed, it can be set to None.
