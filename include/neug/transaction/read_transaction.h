 * @brief Read-only transaction for consistent snapshot access to graph data.
 *
 * ReadTransaction provides read access to graph data at a specific timestamp,
 * implementing snapshot isolation. It owns a generation-validated
 * ReadSnapshotLease: the visibility timestamp, view generation, and pinned
 * snapshot are acquired as ONE coherent object by
 * ReadSnapshotLease::Acquire and can no longer be assembled from independent
 * parts (read-view publication protocol, issue #793).
 *
 * **Implementation Details:**
 * - Stores const reference to PropertyGraph for read-only access
 * - Maintains timestamp for consistent snapshot view
 * - Calls release() in destructor for cleanup
 * - Commit() simply calls release() and returns true
 *
 * **Thread Safety:** Read operations are safe for concurrent access.
 *
 * @since v0.1.0
