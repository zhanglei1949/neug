   * tries in order:
   *   1. FICLONE ioctl (reflink/COW clone) - preserves sparse holes, zero copy
   *   2. copy_file_range() - server-side copy, may use COW on supported FS

   * All three paths produce an independent inode, so a subsequent open() that
   * copies the snapshot back to a tmp file will never alias the source.
   * Falls back to the base-class fwrite-based Dump() if copy_file() throws.
