/**
 * @brief Core database engine for NeuG graph database system.
 *
 * NeugDB serves as the **primary entry point** for all NeuG graph database
 * operations. It provides a complete lifecycle management API including
 * database initialization, query execution, and graceful shutdown.
 *
 * **Usage Example:**
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // Create and open database
 * neug::NeugDB db;
 * db.Open("/path/to/data", 4);  // 4 threads
 *
 * // Create connection and execute query
 * auto conn = db.Connect();
 * auto result = conn->Query("MATCH (n:Person) RETURN n LIMIT 10");
 *
 * // Process results
 * for (auto& record : result.value()) {
 *   std::cout << record.ToString() << std::endl;
 * }
 *
 * // Close database (persists data)
 * db.Close();
 * @endcode
 *
 * **Key Components:**
 * - PropertyGraph: Underlying graph data storage engine
 * - ExecutionSlot: Cypher query compilation and execution
 * - ConnectionManager: Client connection pool management
 * - IGraphPlanner: Query optimization (GOPT or Greedy planner)
 *
 * **Database Modes:**
 * - `DBMode::READ_ONLY`: Read-only access for analytics workloads
 * - `DBMode::READ_WRITE`: Full transactional read/write access
 *
 * **Thread Safety:** Connection creation and registration are synchronized,
 * and separate connections can execute queries concurrently. Individual
 * Connection instances are not thread-safe.
 *
 * **Resource Management:**
 * - File locking prevents concurrent database access from multiple processes
 * - Automatic WAL (Write-Ahead Log) for crash recovery
 * - Configurable checkpoint on close
 *
 * @note For query execution, obtain a Connection via Connect() method.
 * @note Always call Close() before destroying the NeugDB instance to ensure
 *       data persistence.
 *
 * @see Connection For executing queries against the database
 * @see PropertyGraph For direct graph storage access
 * @see NeugDBConfig For configuration options
 *
 * @since v0.1.0

   * @brief Open the database from persistent storage.

   * Initializes and opens the NeuG database from the specified data directory.
   * This method loads the graph schema, vertex/edge data, and initializes
   * the query processor and planner.
   *
   * **Data Directory Structure:**
   * The data_dir should contain:
   * - `graph.yaml`: Schema definition file
   * - `snapshot/`: Vertex and edge data files
   * - `wal/`: Write-ahead log files (optional, for recovery)
   *
   * **Usage Example:**

   *
   * // Simple open with defaults
   * db.Open("/path/to/graph");
   *
   * // Open with custom settings (8 threads, read-write mode, GOPT planner)
   * db.Open("/path/to/graph", 8, neug::DBMode::READ_WRITE, "gopt");
   * @endcode
   *
   * @param data_dir Path to the graph data directory
   * @param max_thread_num Maximum threads for concurrent operations.
   *        If 0, uses hardware concurrency (number of CPU cores), falling
   *        back to 1 if the runtime cannot detect it.
   * @param mode Database access mode (READ_ONLY or READ_WRITE)
   * @param planner_kind Query planner type: "gopt" (Graph Optimizer) or
   * "greedy"
   * @param checkpoint_on_close Create checkpoint (persist data) when closing
   *
   * @return true if database opened successfully, false otherwise
   *
   * @note This overload is primarily designed for Python bindings.
   * @note For C++ usage, prefer the config-based Open(NeugDBConfig&) overload.
